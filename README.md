- Bash Test Script

---Description

You are in a room with a circle of 100 cups and the cups are numbered sequentially from 1 to 100.
At some point in time, cup #1 will be taken away... Cup #2 will be skipped, and cup #3 will be taken away.
This pattern of skipping one cup and asking the next to leave will keep going around the circle until there is one cup left.
Write a program to determine which cup is left.
Your code should print the answer to the cup challenge when there are 100 cups.
